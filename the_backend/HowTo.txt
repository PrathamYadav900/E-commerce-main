Setup hono because its a lightweight,fast and modern web framework for building APIs. Especially for handling HTTP requests and building microsevices
and its works with cloudflare workers

And now we are going to need a connection pool for cloudflare workers to connect to 
because cloudflare workers open multiple severs all over the internet and that cant connect to the database correctly  
so we will give our database(docker postgres) url to that connection pool that will connect to our database 
get the connection pool url from prisma accelerate

env would have local docker url(only used when we run prisma migrate) and wrangler.toml have connection pool
then we will add prisma( i  prisma and prisma init) and then we will create character model 
 -npx prima generate --no-engine  
 npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate
 import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client/edge'
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

const prisma = new PrismaClient({
    datasourceUrl: env.DATABASE_URL,
}).$extends(withAccelerate())
//super base password

VvSrk%2A%24%23hAQQgGA9q%5E9bx


then make auth rotues that are signup and signin 
then add jwt to it 

shift signin and signup to user.ts and  product routes to product.ts 

use params to extract data from url 
make a middleware using "use " and next() 
and we will use set() and get() to set user id and get user id
c.req.header("autherization) this is to pass the auth that we get when we signup 
// c.set("userId",String(user.id)); // "c" does not have userID it have req , json and body  

// create a common folder add typescript to it and do that rootdir ,outdir and declaration
